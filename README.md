# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

-This Tic Tac Toe game is made by Harman Sandhu.

-It uses basic HTML, CSS, Javascipt.

-Written the HTML code for the basic structuring of the game.

-Used CSS properties to design the game.

-In script.js file, used function named "changeTurn" to change the turn of the players when one has played.

-Made another function "checkWin" to check at each step of the game whether any player has won the game or not.

-Then written the game logic.

-Added the Event listener for the Reset button, so that game resumes from the start whenever it is clicked upon.

-This was my basic Tic Tac Toe game.
